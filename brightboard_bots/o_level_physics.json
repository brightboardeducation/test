Weight is a force (W=mg).\n- Newton's First Law: Balanced forces mean constant velocity or rest (Inertia).\n- Newton's Second Law: F=ma (Resultant force = mass × acceleration).\n- Friction opposes motion. Centripetal force acts towards the center of a circle.\n- Hooke's Law: Extension is proportional to load until the elastic limit.\n\n**Electricity**\n- Static electricity: Like charges repel, unlike attract.\n- Current (I=Q/t), EMF (energy per coulomb), P.D. (energy converted per coulomb).\n- Ohm's Law: V=IR. Series: I same, V adds. Parallel: V same, I adds.\n- Power: P=VI. Energy cost: Units in kWh.\n- Safety: Live (brown), Neutral (blue), Earth (green/yellow). Fuses prevent overcurrent.\n\n**Electronics**\n- C.R.O. measures voltage and time intervals. Y-gain (V/cm), Time-base (s/cm or ms/cm).\n\n**Gas Laws**\n- Boyle's Law: PV=constant (constant T).\n- Charles's Law: V/T=constant (constant P).\n- General Gas Equation: P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂. Temperature in Kelvin (K = °C + 273).\n\n**Magnetism**\n- Like poles repel, unlike attract. Magnetic materials (e.g., iron, steel).\n- Electromagnet strength depends on current, turns, and core material.\n- Fleming's Left-Hand Rule: Force on a current in a magnetic field.\n- Electromagnetic Induction (Faraday's Law): EMF induced by changing magnetic flux.\n- Transformer: V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p = I_p/I_s (for ideal).\n\n**Atomic Physics**\n- Atom: Nucleus (protons, neutrons) and electrons.\n- A (mass number) = Z (atomic number) + N (neutron number). Isotopes have same Z, different A.\n- Radioactivity: Alpha (He nucleus, +2), Beta (electron, -1), Gamma (EM wave, 0).\n- Half-life: Time for half the nuclei to decay.\n\n**Kinetic Theory & States of Matter**\n- Solids: Fixed shape/volume, particles vibrate.\n- Liquids: Fixed volume, particles flow.\n- Gases: No fixed shape/volume, particles move randomly.\n- Brownian motion evidences molecular movement. Diffusion is mixing due to random motion.\n- Evaporation (surface, any temp) vs Boiling (throughout, at boiling point).\n\n**Measurement**\n- Length tools: Ruler (mm), Vernier Calipers (0.1mm), Micrometer (0.01mm).\n- Time: Period T = t/n.\n- Mass (kg, constant) vs Weight (N, W=mg, varies with gravity).\n- Centre of Gravity: Point where weight appears to act. Lower CG and larger base increase stability.\n\n**Moments**\n- Moment = Force × perpendicular distance from pivot (M=Fd).\n- Principle of Moments: For equilibrium, total clockwise moment = total anticlockwise moment.\n\n**Fundamental Quantities & Units**\n- Base quantities: Mass (kg), Length (m), Time (s), Current (A), Temperature (K).\n- Derived quantities: e.g., Speed, Force, Volume.\n- Prefixes: Mega (M, 10⁶), kilo (k, 10³), centi (c, 10⁻²), milli (m, 10⁻³), micro (μ, 10⁻⁶).\n- Scalars (magnitude only: mass, speed) vs Vectors (magnitude & direction: force, velocity).\n\n**Simple Machines**\n- Machine: Device to overcome a load with an effort (e.g., lever, pulley, inclined plane).\n- Mechanical Advantage (M.A.) = Load / Effort.\n- Velocity Ratio (V.R.) = Distance moved by effort / Distance moved by load.\n- Efficiency = (M.A. / V.R.) × 100%. Efficiency is always ≤ 100%.\n\n**Speed, Velocity & Acceleration**\n- Distance (scalar) vs Displacement (vector).\n- Speed = Distance/time (scalar). Velocity = Displacement/time (vector).\n- Acceleration = (v - u)/t. Deceleration is negative acceleration.\n- Equations of Motion: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as.\n- Acceleration due to gravity: g ≈ 10 m/s² downward.\n- Free Fall: u = 0, a = g.\n- Speed-time graph: Gradient = acceleration, Area under graph = distance.\n\n**Work, Energy & Power**\n- Work (J) = Force × distance in direction of force.\n- Energy: Ability to do work. Measured in Joules (J).\n- Potential Energy (PE = mgh). Kinetic Energy (KE = ½mv²).\n- Conservation of Energy: Energy changes form but total remains constant.\n- Power (W) = Work / time = Energy / time.\n\n**Volume & Density**\n- Volume (m³ or cm³): Space occupied. For cuboid: V = l × b × h.\n- Density (kg/m³ or g/cm³) = mass / volume.\n\n**Waves**\n- Wave: Form of moving energy. Transverse (vibration perpendicular to direction) vs Longitudinal (vibration parallel).\n- Terms: Amplitude (A), Wavelength (λ), Period (T), Frequency (f, f=1/T), Speed (v = fλ).\n- Sound: Longitudinal, needs medium, speed ≈ 340 m/s in air, pitch depends on frequency, loudness depends on amplitude.\n- Light: Travels in straight lines, reflects, refracts. Speed in vacuum = 3×10⁸ m/s.\n- Reflection: i = r (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).\n- Refraction: Bending due to speed change. Snell's Law: sin i / sin r = constant (refractive index).\n- Critical Angle: Incidence angle causing refraction at 90°; if exceeded, total internal reflection occurs.\n- Lenses: Converging (convex) lens forms real/virtual images depending on object position relative to focal point (F).\n- Electromagnetic Spectrum: Radio, Microwaves, IR, Visible, UV, X-rays, Gamma rays. All transverse, travel in vacuum at 3×10⁸ m/s.\n\n**Thermal Physics (Expansion & Transfer)**\n- Thermal Expansion: Solids/liquids expand when heated (e.g., bimetallic strip, rails with gaps).\n- Thermometers: Use property changes with temperature (e.g., liquid expansion, resistance).\n- Heat Transfer:\n  - Conduction: Through a medium (solids best).\n  - Convection: By fluid movement (hot rises, cool sinks).\n  - Radiation: Via infrared waves (no medium needed).\n- Applications: Vacuum flask, radiators, greenhouse, solar panels."
