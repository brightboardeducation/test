The launch date for version 2.0 is Q3 2026.\n\n## Subject Knowledge\n\n### Inorganic Chemistry\n- **Carbonates, Oxides & Hydroxides:** Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) decomposes to CaO and CO₂ when heated. CaO (quicklime) reacts with water to form Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime) with heat. Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater) turns milky with CO₂ due to CaCO₃ precipitate.\n- **Acids & Bases:** Acids produce H⁺ ions in water. Strength depends on ionization extent (strong: HCl, H₂SO₄; weak: CH₃COOH). Bases neutralize acids. Alkalis are soluble bases (e.g., NaOH, Ca(OH)₂) producing OH⁻ ions. The pH scale (0-14) measures acidity/alkalinity.\n- **Air & Non-Metals:** Dry air is ~79% N₂, 20% O₂, 0.04% CO₂, 0.93% noble gases. Key gases: Hydrogen (H₂) – pop test; Oxygen (O₂) – relights glowing splint; Ammonia (NH₃) – turns damp red litmus blue; Chlorine (Cl₂) – greenish-yellow, bleaching agent.\n- **Metals & Extraction:** Reactivity series determines extraction method: Electrolysis for very reactive metals (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al); Reduction by coke for moderately reactive (Zn, Fe, Pb); Heating for less reactive (Cu, Ag, Au).\n- **Alloys:** Mixtures of metals or a metal with a non-metal (e.g., Brass: Cu+Zn; Steel: Fe+C). Harder and more corrosion-resistant than pure metals.\n\n### Physical Chemistry\n- **Electrochemistry:** Electrolysis decomposes an electrolyte using electric current. Electrolytes conduct electricity when molten/dissolved. Anions discharge at anode, cations at cathode. Factors affecting discharge: position in electrochemical series, ion concentration, electrode nature.\n- **Faraday's Laws:** 1st Law: mass deposited ∝ charge passed. 2nd Law: For same charge, moles deposited ∝ 1/(ion charge). 1 Faraday = 96500 C = 1 mole of electrons.\n- **Dilution & Calculations:** Dilution law: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂. Calculations from equations use mole ratios.\n\n### Organic & Materials Chemistry\n- **Allotropes of Carbon:** Diamond (hard, non-conductor, tetrahedral) and Graphite (soft, conductor, layered) are allotropes.\n- **Bonding:** Ionic bonding involves electron transfer (metal to non-metal). Covalent bonding involves electron sharing (non-metals). Metallic bonding involves a 'sea' of delocalized electrons.\n\n### Chemical Principles\n- **Writing Formulas:** Use valencies to combine ions (e.g., Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃).\n- **Rusting:** Corrosion of iron requiring O₂, H₂O, and an electrolyte. Prevent by painting, oiling, galvanizing, alloying.\n- **Fertilizers:** Provide essential elements N, P, K. E.g., Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) from NH₃ + HNO₃.\n- **Contact Process:** Manufacture of H₂SO₄ from S, O₂, H₂O using V₂O₅ catalyst at ~450°C.\n- **Haber Process:** Manufacture of NH₃ from N₂ and H₂ using Fe catalyst, ~450°C, high pressure.\n\n### Updated Additions from New PDFs:\n\n- **Empirical & Molecular Formulas:** Empirical formula shows simplest atom ratio.

React with water → metal hydroxide + H₂. Flame tests: Li=red, Na=yellow, K=lilac.\n- **Group VII (Halogens):** F, Cl, Br, I, At. Diatomic molecules. Reactivity ↑ up group. Displacement reactions occur. Physical state: F,Cl=gas; Br=liquid; I=solid.\n- **Group 0 (Noble Gases):** He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn. Unreactive, monatomic, full outer shell.\n- **Transition Elements:** Between Groups II & III. Properties: high density/m.p., good conductors, variable valency, coloured compounds, act as catalysts. Examples: Fe, Cu, Zn, Ag, Au.\n- **Water (H₂O):** Test: turns CoCl₂ paper pink, CuSO₄ white→blue, boils at 100°C. Purification: filtration → chlorination. Hardness due to Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ salts.
