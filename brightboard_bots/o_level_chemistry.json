  "custom_knowledge": "## Proprietary Knowledge Document: Chemistry Knowledge\n\n1. The official color scheme for the Chemistry page is primary dark Magenta (#8B008B) and secondary orange (#FF8A5B).\n2. All user authentication must use Firebase Auth only. No other providers are permitted.\n3. The Chemistry page name must be capitalized in all marketing communication.\n4. The launch date for version 2.0 is Q3 2026.\n\n## Subject Knowledge\n\n### Inorganic Chemistry\n- **Carbonates, Oxides & Hydroxides:** Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) decomposes to CaO and CO₂ when heated. CaO (quicklime) reacts with water to form Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime) with heat. Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater) turns milky with CO₂ due to CaCO₃ precipitate.\n- **Acids & Bases:** Acids produce H⁺ ions in water. Strength depends on ionization extent (strong: HCl, H₂SO₄; weak: CH₃COOH). Bases neutralize acids. Alkalis are soluble bases (e.g., NaOH, Ca(OH)₂) producing OH⁻ ions. The pH scale (0-14) measures acidity/alkalinity.\n- **Air & Non-Metals:** Dry air is ~79% N₂, 20% O₂, 0.04% CO₂, 0.93% noble gases. Key gases: Hydrogen (H₂) – pop test; Oxygen (O₂) – relights glowing splint; Ammonia (NH₃) – turns damp red litmus blue; Chlorine (Cl₂) – greenish-yellow, bleaching agent.\n- **Metals & Extraction:** Reactivity series determines extraction method: Electrolysis for very reactive metals (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al); Reduction by coke for moderately reactive (Zn, Fe, Pb); Heating for less reactive (Cu, Ag, Au).\n- **Alloys:** Mixtures of metals or a metal with a non-metal (e.g., Brass: Cu+Zn; Steel: Fe+C). Harder and more corrosion-resistant than pure metals.\n\n### Physical Chemistry\n- **Electrochemistry:** Electrolysis decomposes an electrolyte using electric current. Electrolytes conduct electricity when molten/dissolved. Anions discharge at anode, cations at cathode. Factors affecting discharge: position in electrochemical series, ion concentration, electrode nature.\n- **Faraday's Laws:** 1st Law: mass deposited ∝ charge passed. 2nd Law: For same charge, moles deposited ∝ 1/(ion charge). 1 Faraday = 96500 C = 1 mole of electrons.\n- **Dilution & Calculations:** Dilution law: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂. Calculations from equations use mole ratios.\n\n### Organic & Materials Chemistry\n- **Allotropes of Carbon:** Diamond (hard, non-conductor, tetrahedral) and Graphite (soft, conductor, layered) are allotropes.\n- **Bonding:** Ionic bonding involves electron transfer (metal to non-metal). Covalent bonding involves electron sharing (non-metals). Metallic bonding involves a 'sea' of delocalized electrons.\n\n### Chemical Principles\n- **Writing Formulas:** Use valencies to combine ions (e.g., Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃).\n- **Rusting:** Corrosion of iron requiring O₂, H₂O, and an electrolyte. Prevent by painting, oiling, galvanizing, alloying.\n- **Fertilizers:** Provide essential elements N, P, K. E.g., Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) from NH₃ + HNO₃.\n- **Contact Process:** Manufacture of H₂SO₄ from S, O₂, H₂O using V₂O₅ catalyst at ~450°C.\n- **Haber Process:** Manufacture of NH₃ from N₂ and H₂ using Fe catalyst, ~450°C, high pressure.\n\n### Updated Additions from New PDFs:\n\n- **Empirical & Molecular Formulas:** Empirical formula shows simplest atom ratio. Molecular formula shows actual atom numbers. M.F = (E.F)ₙ where n = Molar mass / Empirical formula mass.\n- **Percentage Yield & Purity:** % Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100%. % Purity = (Mass of pure substance / Mass of impure sample) × 100%. Actual yield is often lower due to impurities, reversibility, or losses.\n- **Elements, Mixtures & Compounds:** Elements are pure, cannot be split chemically. Mixtures contain substances not chemically combined (e.g., air, brass). Compounds contain elements chemically combined in fixed ratios (e.g., H₂O, NaCl).\n- **Electron Configuration:** Arrangement of electrons in shells (K, L, M, N). Maximum electrons per shell = 2n². Metals have 1-3 outer electrons; non-metals have 4-7.\n- **Equations:** Word, symbol, and ionic equations. Ionic equations show only reacting ions (spectator ions cancelled). Balancing ensures atom conservation.\n- **States of Matter & Changes:** Solid, liquid, gas. Changes: Melting (solid→liquid), Evaporation/Boiling (liquid→gas), Condensation (gas→liquid), Freezing (liquid→solid), Sublimation (solid↔gas). Heating/Cooling curves show temperature vs. time during state changes."
