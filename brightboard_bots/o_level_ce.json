GLOBAL ISSUES\n\n### Introduction & Global Interdependence\n- **Globalisation**: Making worldwide; world as \"Global Village\" due to communication/transport advances.\n- **Global Issues**: Developments/problems affecting welfare of all nations.\n- **Global Interdependence**: Nations depend on each other for decisions, policies, goods, services.\n\n### Foreign Aid\n- **Definition**: International transfer of funds/goods/services as loans/grants.\n- **Types**:\n  - *Bilateral*: One country to another (e.g., SIDA, JICA, USAID).\n  - *Multilateral*: International agencies (e.g., ADB, IMF, World Bank).\n- **Grants**: Gifts, not repaid.\n- **Loans**: Repaid with interest (hard = high interest, soft = low/no interest).\n- **Tied Aid**: Conditions attached (e.g., spend on specific project, allow military bases).\n\n### Role of World Bank & IMF\n- **World Bank (IBRD)**: Loans to developing countries (15-20yrs grace) & poor countries (10yrs grace, 35-40yrs repayment).\n- **IMF**: Regulates international monetary system, controls exchange rates, lends for balance-of-payments deficits, advises on economic reforms.\n\n### Arguments For & Against Foreign Aid\n- **For**: Provides capital, foreign exchange, technology/skills, government revenue, food aid alleviates famine, promotes cooperation.\n- **Against**: Tied aid expensive/low quality, undermines independence, profits externalised, debt burden worsens, food aid kills local agriculture, technical assistance benefits donor more.\n\n### International Trade\n- **Types**: Internal (Domestic) & External (International).\n- **Importance**: Uneven resource distribution, climatic differences, specialisation/comparative advantage, technological differences, supplement domestic production, earn foreign exchange, promote international cooperation.\n- **Terms of Trade**: Rate exports exchanged for imports. Favourable = export prices higher; Unfavourable = export prices lower.\n- **Balance of Trade**: Difference value visible imports/exports. Surplus (exports > imports); Deficit (imports > exports).\n- **Balance of Payments**: Difference spending/earnings from imports/exports (includes invisible services). Surplus (earn more from exports); Deficit (spend more on imports).\n\n### World Trade Organisation (WTO)\n- **Origins**: Established 1995, replaced GATT (1947).\n- **Functions**: Reduce/eliminate tariffs, set trade rules, settle disputes, organise negotiations.\n- **Principles**: Non-discrimination (MFN, national treatment), Free trade, Predictability, Competition, Special privileges for LDCs.\n- **Structure**: 146 members, HQ Geneva; organs: Council of Ministers, General Council, Sector Councils, Committees.\n- **Weaknesses**: \"Club for the rich,\" decisions influenced by developed countries, LDCs lack equal platform.\n\n### Debt Crisis\n- Zambia's external debt (2004): $6.5bn (57% multilateral, 35% bilateral).\n- **Causes**:\n  - Unfair international trade (undervalued commodities, raw materials sold cheaply).\n  - Debt servicing (paying interest; new loans to service old). In 2004: $377m debt servicing vs $221m education.\n  - Spending loans on consumption, corruption.\n\n### Debt Relief & HIPC Initiative\n- **HIPC Initiative**: Introduced 1996, revised 1999, to reduce debt to sustainable levels & fund poverty reduction.\n- **Qualification & SAPs**: Must implement IMF/World Bank reforms (privatise, lift investment restrictions, reduce tariffs, float exchange rates, fiscal discipline, remove price controls/subsidies, relax labour laws).\n- **Zambia's HIPC Completion Point Benchmarks**: Poverty Reduction (PRSP), Education (increase budget to 23%, teacher reforms), Health (HIV/AIDS framework, malaria control), Macro-economic (privatise ZESCO, ZANACO), Water (rehabilitate urban supply).\n- **Benefits**: Debt relief ($3.8bn), reduced payments ($450-650m/yr saved), reduction in total debt stock.\n- **Concerns**: Debt stock may not reduce (continued borrowing), misuse of relief funds, loss of national sovereignty (policies imposed).\n\n### Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\n- Eight goals agreed at UN Millennium Summit 2000, target 2015.\n1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty & Hunger.\n2. Achieve Universal Primary Education.\n3. Promote Gender Equality & Empower Women.\n4. Reduce Child Mortality.\n5. Improve Maternal Health.\n6.
